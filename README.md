# Unity-Mod-Maker
Installation Instructions:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure Python 3.9 is installed (Works best if installed via Microsoft Store)</li>
    <li>Make sure Dotnet is installed (Only tested on 5.0.400 but any version that works for modding should work)</li>
    <li>The game you are modding must be installed and have BepInEx Setup (and PolyTechFramework if you are using that)</li>
    <li>There are some modules you may need to install for python for the software to run, running Setup.bat should install them all for you</li>
    <li>Once it is all set up, run UnityModMaker.bat to use the program or run GraphicalInterface.py (less likely to work)</li>
</ul>
