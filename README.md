# This is a fork of HippoLippo's Unity Mod Maker that was designed for poly bridge 2.
I am making this for the game Isle Goblin. \
There have been themeing changes aswell.

# Isle Goblin Mod Maker
Note: This is the windows fork of the project, a Linux fork does not exist yet<br>
<h1>Installation Instructions:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure Dotnet SDK is installed (Only tested on 5.0.400 but any version that works for modding should work)</li>
    <li>The game you are modding must be installed and be a CSharp Unity Game - Though it is specifically designed for Isle Goblin</li>
    <li>Run "Isle Goblin Mod Maker.exe" to use the tool (If this fails download the code and run main.py)</li>
</ul>
